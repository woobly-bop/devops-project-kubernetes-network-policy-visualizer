## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Kubernetes Network Policies are difficult to understand by reading YAML files directly.  
This project provides a visualization tool that converts Kubernetes NetworkPolicy YAML files into an interactive network graph showing allowed and blocked traffic between pods.

### Objectives
- Parse Kubernetes NetworkPolicy YAML files
- Extract pod communication rules
- Generate a visual graph of allowed and denied connections
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Deploy the tool on Kubernetes

### Key Features
- YAML parser for NetworkPolicy files
- Graph-based visualization of pod communication
- Dockerized application
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
